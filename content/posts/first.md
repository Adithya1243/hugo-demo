## Outlooks on an Obscure Life

College was the best thing that had happened to me. I miss being a student. I officially parted ways with college in the April of 2019. I made many plans to pursue my hobbies such as photography and travelling during the vacations. I didn't feel cuffed anymore. When I look back to my life at college, the moments of momentary pleasure were when we either bunked a class or when we got a half-day leave by convincing our HOD. There were a lucky few who got their way with the HOD. And we always put their skills to a good use ðŸ˜‰. The challenging part in the final semester was the mini and the major project. It didn't matter what we presented to our guides, nothing seemed to put a smile on their face let alone impressing them.

The faculties whom I had good rapport with, suggested me to consider a field in research or teaching. Some even suggested to take up government jobs due to its job security and its added perks. While there is always merit in what they had suggested, I was never at peace with what I wanted to do with my life. Every step of education is scripted. And I believe I did justice in playing my part the best way I could have. For me, there were no vocations. Only hobbies. I was left alone in an open field to find my calling and to harvest it.

One fine day, it dawned upon me that the pursuit for 'want' is perpetual. So, I decided to make the best use of what I have right now, hoping that I would land in the right place. As Vivekananda said, _"If what we are now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly follows that whatever we wish to be in the future can be produced by our present actions; so, we have to know how to act."_ I want to be the best version of myself so that when I look back, I don't want any regrets in the decisions I made. It is tough being in the director's seat of life. But there is a thrill to witness how life unfolds ðŸ˜‰.

Looking back to the exam day when I put down my pen, it weighed heavy on my heart that I will not be seeing my friends in one room again. From now on, there must be a special reason to get together as there is no need to maintain attendance nor to get dressed in a uniform anymore. I still remember that moment when we were done with the final semester exams. Everybody was in a hurry to celebrate or to rush home to have the best relaxation of their life.

We all felt like caged birds throughout the college. Since we were suddenly set free, most of us did not have a destination in mind. Everyone decided to go with the flow and see where we land at. Some landed a job while others landed abroad to pursue a master's degree. Thanks to the video calling facility that we can see each other occasionally. Of course, there are WhatsApp groups to send out birthday wishes, sharing old photos and so on.

From my vantage point, the world is a completely unexplored territory to me. I decided to join the corporate world to understand and decode how the world works. There is a long journey ahead of me with the sails and aims set high. As the elders say, there is a big scary world out there. I need to muster up all the strength and bravery to face it. But, to us zealots, life is an endless pursuit of thrill and adventure.
